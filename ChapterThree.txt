//Chapter Three//

Valhalla presents the player with a massive, nominally “open” game world spanning Norway and England during the Middle Ages. It is undeniably breathtaking, beautifully lit, meticulously designed: the peak of what we now expect from games with a built-in photo mode.

And it’s full of things to see and do. The game’s map overwhelms with points of interest and details, so much so that decoding the many types of waypoint is a task in and of itself. As a result, Valhalla feels like the epitome of the current wave of big-budget, open-world historical games, which revolve almost entirely around overloading players with stuff and seem designed never to be truly “completed.”

It feels like an argument encoded within both marketing campaigns and the games themselves: the more stuff they have, the more space they allow players to explore, the more “alive” and reactive it feels to the player, the more “historically authentic” the game automatically is. The more time you spend there, the more immersed you are in the historical world, the more you feel like you understand how it worked “way back then” (or, rather, how the game developers are telling you it worked).

And it’s easy to get lost in simply exploring this world and experiencing its many ambient elements. Valhalla’s Mysteries—the kooky little side stories players can choose to investigate rather than following the main narrative from location to location—are often funny or meaningful, and sometimes just really stupid.2 Some are actually quite jarring, like having to tell two little girls that their father has drowned while hunting for treasure, after which Eivor, the game’s protagonist, laments, “This world is hard, and the gods care not.” These stories do a good job of painting a portrait of a hard, brutal historical world and the lives of people within it.
